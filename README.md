# SillyJones

SillyJones is a dapp that lets you bond **x** [jAsset tokens](https://docs.jonesdao.io/jones-dao/features/jassets) to mint **x + x*0.25** SillyJonesTokens. The bond matures linearly over 5 days. The goal of the protocol is to accumulate as many jAsset tokens as possible.

## Learning
This is a fun little project I created to demonstrate my Solidity skills and understanding of DEFI.

## Dependencies
* Foundry/Forge for testing
* Openzapplin for ERC20 and a few other libraries
